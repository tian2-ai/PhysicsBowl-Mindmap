## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Problems: 3 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Hard (<50)

## Introduction

- Einstein's Relativity extends the concept of time and space from classical physics to speed close to the speed of light.
- Photons and photo electric effect are the basis of quantum mechanics, and it talks about the particle nature of light.
- Radioactive decay is the basis of nuclear physics, and it talks about the nuclear force, and the energy released in the process.

## Key Concepts

### Relativistic Physics

#### Lorentz Factor
- $$
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  $$

#### Time Dilation
- $$
  \Delta t = \gamma \,\Delta t_0
  $$

#### Length Contraction
- $$
  L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}
  $$

#### Relativistic Momentum
- $$
  p = \gamma m v
  $$

#### Relativistic Energy
- $$
  E = \gamma\,m c^2, \quad E_0 = m c^2, \quad K = (\gamma - 1)\,m c^2
  $$
- Energy-momentum relation:
  $$
  E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2
  $$

#### Velocity Addition
- $$
  v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
  $$

### Photoelectric Effect
- Photon energy:
  $$
  E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
  $$
- Kinetic energy of ejected electrons:
  $$
  KE_e = E_{\text{photon}} - W_0
  $$

#### Radioactive Decay
- Decay law:
  $$
  N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
  $$
- Half-life:
  $$
  t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}
  $$

#### Nuclear Decay Modes
- Alpha Decay: $-2 \, Z, -4 \, A$
- Beta Decay:
  - $\beta^-$: $n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$
  - $\beta^+$: $p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e$
- Electron Capture:
  $$
  p + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e
  $$

#### Energy Density
- Nuclear reactions release $10^6 \times$ the energy of chemical reactions.

## Question Types

### Relativistic Physics
- Energy and Momentum Conservation:
  - Solve for $p$ or $E$ using:
    $$
    E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2
    $$
- Time Dilation/Length Contraction:
  - Calculate stretched time intervals or contracted lengths for moving observers.
- Velocity Addition:
  - Relativistic formula replaces classical addition at high speeds.

### Modern Physics
- Photoelectric Effect:
  - Find $W_0$, $KE_e$, or $\lambda$ from photon interactions.
- Radioactive Decay:
  - Calculate remaining nuclei or elapsed time using:
    $$
    N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
    $$
- Nuclear Transformations:
  - Track atomic/mass number changes in decay processes.

## Skills

- Use Lorentz Factor:
  - Master $\gamma$ for time, length, and energy relations.
- Apply Conservation Laws:
  - Energy and momentum must balance in relativistic and nuclear contexts.
- Track Decay Products:
  - Follow transformations in alpha, beta, and electron capture processes.

## Study Tips

1. Understand Frame of Reference:
   - Identify rest vs. moving frames for proper application of time dilation/length contraction.
2. Use Energy-Momentum Relations:
   - For high-speed or massless particles, solve for $E$, $p$, or $\gamma$.
3. Learn Decay Patterns:
   - Practice alpha/beta decay and identify daughter nuclei.
4. Check Dimensional Consistency:
   - Validate results by ensuring units match (e.g., energy in joules).
