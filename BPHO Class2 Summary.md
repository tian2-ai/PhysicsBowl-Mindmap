# BPHO Class2 Summary

## Kinematics: 2-D, Relative Motion

### Relative velocity.

### Vector addition for combining velocities.

### Applications: Boat crossing a river, airplane in the wind.

### Key takeaway: Relative motion allows you to analyze motion from different reference frames.

### Common mistake: Not considering vector direction, forgetting that velocities are vectors.

## Kinematics: 2-D, Projectile Motion

### Horizontal motion: constant velocity.

### Vertical motion: constant acceleration (-g), where (g) is the acceleration due to gravity.

### Time of flight:

### Range:

### Maximum height: 

### Key takeaway: Horizontal and vertical motions are independent but share the same time variable.

### Common mistake: Using the wrong value for gravity (e.g., positive instead of negative).

## Forces and Different Force Types

### Gravitational force: 

### Normal force: Perpendicular to the surface.

### Tension force: Along a string or rope.

### Frictional force: notice that there are kinetic and static friction, and these two types of friction are different in magnitude

### Key takeaway: Recognize the different forces acting on an object and understand their directions.

### Common mistake: Forgetting about friction or normal force.

## Force and Relation to Kinematics

### Force is related to acceleration through Newton's second law: (F = ma).

### Can use kinematics equations to find distance, time, etc. once acceleration is known.

### Key takeaway: Force directly affects the motion of an object through acceleration.

## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force (Inertia).

### Second Law: (F = ma).

### Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### Key takeaway: Newton's laws are fundamental principles for understanding motion and forces.

### Common mistake: Thinking that forces in the third law cancel each other (they act on different bodies).

## Bonus tips for BPHO preparation:

### Break vectors into components to simplify problems.

### Use free body diagrams to visualize the forces acting on an object.

### Double-check your math and units.
