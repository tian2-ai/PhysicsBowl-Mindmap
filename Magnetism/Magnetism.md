## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Problems: 2 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Hard (<50)

## Introduction

- Magnetism deals with the interaction of moving charges and magnetic fields.
- Topics include forces on charges and wires, magnetic fields generated by currents, and electromagnetic induction.

## Key Concepts

### Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
  $$
  - Magnitude: $F = q v B \sin(\theta)$.

### Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Wire
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \mathbf{F} = I (\mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}), \quad F = I L B \sin(\theta)
  $$

### Magnetic Field Due to a Current
- **Long Straight Wire**:
  $$
  B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}
  $$
  - $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{N/A^2}$, $r$: Distance from wire.

### Faraday’s Law of Induction
- **Induced EMF**:
  $$
  \varepsilon = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
  $$
  - $\Phi_B$: Magnetic flux, $\Phi_B = \int \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$.

### Lenz’s Law
- The direction of induced current opposes the change in magnetic flux.

### Circular Motion in a Magnetic Field
- **Radius of Circular Path**:
  $$
  r = \frac{m v}{q B}
  $$

## Question Types

### Magnetic Forces and Motion
- Find forces and trajectories of charges or wires in magnetic fields.
- Calculate circular or helical paths of particles in uniform fields.

### Magnetic Fields from Currents
- Use Biot-Savart or Ampère’s Law to compute fields near wires, loops, or solenoids.

### Electromagnetic Induction
- Solve for induced EMF or current using Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law.
- Analyze effects of moving magnets and changing magnetic fields.

## Skills

- **Right-Hand Rule**:
  - Determine directions of forces, fields, and induced currents.
- **Vector Cross Products**:
  - Apply $\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$ and $\mathbf{F} = I (\mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B})$ accurately.
- **Combined Fields**:
  - Manage scenarios with coexisting electric and magnetic fields using:
    $$
    \mathbf{F}_{\text{total}} = q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}).
    $$

## Study Tips

1. **Master the Right-Hand Rule**:
   - Thumb: velocity or current, index: field, middle finger: force.
2. **Check Cross Product Directions**:
   - Ensure correct orientation for forces and fields.
3. **Understand Field Interactions**:
   - Analyze problems with both $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ fields systematically.
