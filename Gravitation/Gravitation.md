## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Questions: 2 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Medium (<40)

## Introduction

- Gravitation: Mutual attraction between masses.
- Applications in planetary motion, satellites, and escape velocity.
- Key concepts include gravitational force, potential energy, and orbits.

## Key Concepts

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
- **Force between two masses**:
  $$
  F = \frac{G M_1 M_2}{r^2}
  $$

### Gravitational Potential Energy
- **Energy in two-mass systems**:
  $$
  U = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{r}
  $$

### Orbital Speed and Escape Velocity
- **Orbital speed (circular orbit)**:
  $$
  v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
  $$
- **Escape velocity**:
  $$
  v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}
  $$

### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
1. **First Law**: Planets orbit in ellipses with the Sun at one focus.
2. **Second Law**: Equal areas are swept out in equal times.
3. **Third Law**:
   $$
   T^2 \propto a^3
   $$

### Angular Momentum and Energy in Orbits
- **Angular Momentum**:
  $$
  L = m v r
  $$
- **Total Mechanical Energy**:
  $$
  E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{G M m}{r}
  $$

## Question Types

### Gravity and Related Quantities
- Analyze weight, field strength, and potential energy variations for different planets.

### Planetary Motion and Centripetal Force
- Use gravitational force as centripetal force in orbits.
- Apply Kepler's laws for elliptical motion.

### Satellite Problems
- Calculate orbital speed, period, and conditions for geostationary orbits.
- Determine escape velocity for satellites or objects leaving a planet.

## Skills

- **Universal Gravitation**:
  - Approximate central forces acting at distance $r$.
- **Orbital Mechanics**:
  - Relate gravitational and centripetal forces.
- **Energy and Momentum Conservation**:
  - Track potential and kinetic energy changes in gravitational systems.

## Study Tips

1. **Leverage Symmetry**:
   - Treat spherical masses as point masses concentrated at their center.
2. **Relate Centripetal Acceleration**:
   - Use gravitational force as the centripetal force for orbital calculations.
3. **Master Kepler's Laws**:
   - Link orbital radius, period, and velocity effectively.
4. **Check Units**:
   - Ensure consistency, particularly in SI units (meters, kilograms).
