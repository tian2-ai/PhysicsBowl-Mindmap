## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Problems: 3 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Medium (<40)

## Introduction

- Motion along a circular path at constant speed.
- Centripetal Acceleration:
  - Points toward the center, changing direction of velocity but not magnitude.

## Key Concepts

### Centripetal Acceleration
- Definition: Acceleration toward the center of a circle.
- Formula:
  $$
  a_{\text{c}} = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r = \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} r
  $$

### Centripetal Force
- Definition: Net inward force maintaining circular motion.
- Formula:
  $$
  F_{\text{c}} = m \frac{v^2}{r} = m \omega^2 r = m \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} r
  $$
- Not an additional force; arises from forces like tension, gravity, or friction.

### Linear and Angular Relationships
- Linear Velocity:
  $$
  v = \omega r
  $$
- Period of Motion:
  $$
  T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
  $$

### Radial and Tangential Components
- Focus on radial (inward) forces for uniform motion.
- Tangential acceleration is zero when speed is constant.

## Question Types

### Concept Problems
- Why velocity is tangent while acceleration is radial.
- How centripetal force arises from net inward forces.
- Impact of removing or altering centripetal force.

### Centripetal Force Analysis
- Turntable/Motion Around a Pole:
  - Analyze friction or tension as the centripetal force.
- Conical Pendulum:
  - Decompose tension into vertical and radial components.
- Flat or Banked Curve:
  - Identify friction or normal force providing centripetal acceleration.
- Vertical Circle:
  - Account for varying forces (tension and weight) at top/bottom of the loop.

## Skills

- Radial and Tangential Decomposition:
  - Separate forces into components; focus on radial for uniform motion.
- Free-Body Diagrams:
  - Sketch forces (tension, friction, gravity, normal) to identify centripetal contributions.
- Trigonometric Analysis:
  - Essential for conical pendulums or banked curve scenarios.

## Study Tips

1. Link Force and Acceleration:
   - Identify forces responsible for centripetal acceleration.
2. Analyze Edge Cases:
   - Consider top/bottom of vertical circles or minimum speeds.
3. Understand Angular Quantities:
   - Relate velocity, angular speed, and period.
4. Confident Trigonometry:
   - Decompose forces in angled problems.
