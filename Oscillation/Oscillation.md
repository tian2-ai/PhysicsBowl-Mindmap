## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Problems: 2â€“3 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Medium (<40)

## Introduction

- Oscillatory systems involve back-and-forth motion about an equilibrium position.
- Examples: Simple pendulum and mass-spring systems.
- Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM): Sinusoidal behavior with well-defined periods for small displacements.

## Key Concepts

### Simple Pendulum
- Period:
  $$
  T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
  $$
  - Independent of mass and amplitude for small angles.

### Physical Pendulum
- Period:
  $$
  T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{I}{m g d}}
  $$
  - $I$: Moment of inertia about pivot, $d$: Distance from pivot to center of mass.

### Mass-Spring System
- Period:
  $$
  T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
  $$
  - Independent of amplitude under ideal conditions.

### Oscillation Equations
- General Form:
  $$
  x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
  $$
  - $A$: Amplitude, $\omega$: Angular frequency, $\phi$: Phase constant.
  
### Energy in Oscillation
- Total Energy (Mass-Spring):
  $$
  E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
  $$
  - $A$: Amplitude.
- Energy Transformation (Pendulum):
  - Potential energy at the highest point: $mgh$.
  - Kinetic energy at the lowest point: $\frac{1}{2} m v^2$.
### Resonance
- Definition:
  - Large amplitude oscillations occur when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency.

### Forces in Oscillations
- Tension in Pendulum (Lowest Point):
  $$
  T = mg + \frac{m v^2}{L}
  $$
  - $v$: Speed at the bottom, $L$: Pendulum length.

## Question Types

### Mass-Spring Systems
