## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Problems: 2 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Intermediate (<40)

## Introduction

- Electrostatics focuses on charges at rest and their interactions through electric forces and fields.
- Key applications include vector addition for electric field calculations and scalar computations for potential and potential energy.

## Key Concepts

### Coulomb's Law
- Force between two charges:
  $$
  F = k \frac{|Q_1 Q_2|}{r^2}
  $$
  - $k \approx 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N\,m^2/C^2}$.

### Electric Field
- Field due to a point charge:
  $$
  \vec{E} = \frac{k Q}{r^2} \hat{r}
  $$
  - Radially outward for positive charges, inward for negative charges.

### Electric Potential
- Potential at a distance from a charge:
  $$
  V = \frac{k Q}{r}
  $$

### Work and Potential Energy
- Work:
  $$
  W = q \Delta V
  $$
  - Moving a charge $q$ through a potential difference $\Delta V$.
- Potential Energy:
  $$
  U = q V
  $$

### Electric Fields in Capacitors
- Uniform field in a parallel-plate capacitor:
  $$
  E = \frac{\Delta V}{d}
  $$

## Question Types

### Conceptual Questions
- Behavior of charges and electric fields.
- Charge distributions on conductors and potential differences.

### Field and Potential Calculations
- Use superposition for electric fields (vector) and potentials (scalar).

### Work and Energy
- Compute work done by electric forces and changes in potential energy.

## Skills

- Vector Manipulation:
  - Add electric field vectors and use symmetry where applicable.
- Field Lines and Equipotentials:
  - Interpret and sketch electric field lines and equipotential surfaces.
- Capacitor Analysis:
  - Relate field strength, voltage, and plate separation.

## Study Tips

1. Master Core Equations:
   - Focus on $F = k \frac{|Q_1 Q_2|}{r^2}$, $\vec{E} = \frac{k Q}{r^2}$, and $V = \frac{k Q}{r}$.
2. Visualize Field Lines:
   - Understand the geometry of electric fields around charges and conductors.
3. Practice Superposition:
   - Combine fields or potentials from multiple charges efficiently.
4. Relate Work and Energy:
   - Use $W = q \Delta V$ and $U = q V$ to connect force, potential, and energy.
