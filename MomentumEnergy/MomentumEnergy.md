## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Problems: 3 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Medium (<40)

## Introduction

- **Momentum ($\mathbf{p}$)**: Measure of "quantity of motion" of an object.
- **Energy**: Capacity to do work; includes:
  - Kinetic Energy ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$)
  - Potential Energy (e.g., gravitational, elastic).
- Conservation laws enable efficient problem-solving in scenarios like collisions, projectiles, and spring systems.

## Key Concepts

### Momentum
- **Linear Momentum**:
  $$
  \mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v}
  $$
- **Impulse--Momentum Theorem**:
  $$
  \Delta \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} \Delta t
  $$

### Energy
- **Kinetic Energy**:
  $$
  K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
  $$
- **Gravitational Potential Energy**:
  $$
  U_g = m g h
  $$
- **Spring Potential Energy**:
  $$
  U_s = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
  $$
- **Total Mechanical Energy**:
  $$
  E_{\text{total}} = K + U
  $$
- **Calculating Work**:
  $$
  W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d}
  $$
- **Work--Energy Theorem**:
  $$
  W = \Delta K
  $$

### Conservation Laws
- **Momentum Conservation**:
  - Applies in closed systems without external forces.
- **Energy Conservation**:
  - Applies when no energy is lost to non-conservative forces (e.g., friction).

## Question Types

### Concept Problems
- Differentiate energy forms (kinetic, potential, thermal).
- Momentum conservation in closed systems.
- Conditions for energy conservation.

### Using Energy Conservation
- Relate changes in potential and kinetic energy to solve for:
  - Final velocities
  - Displacements
  - Heights

### Collisions
- **Elastic Collision**:
  - Both momentum and kinetic energy conserved.
  - Solve simultaneous equations for final velocities.
- **Inelastic Collision**:
  - Momentum conserved; some kinetic energy lost.
  - Perfectly inelastic: objects stick together post-collision.

## Skills

- **Conservation Laws**:
  - Identify and apply momentum or energy conservation.
- **Vector Manipulation**:
  - Especially important for 2D collisions.
- **Dot Product**:
  - Use for work calculations: $\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d}$.
- **Equation Solving**:
  - Simultaneously conserve momentum and energy in complex problems.

## Study Tips

1. **Identify Conservation Laws**:
   - Check for external forces or energy losses.
2. **Use Vector Components**:
   - Break vectors into components for 2D problems.
3. **Track Energy Transformations**:
   - Observe conversions between kinetic and potential energies.
4. **Focus on Efficiency**:
   - Use conservation principles to simplify problem-solving.
