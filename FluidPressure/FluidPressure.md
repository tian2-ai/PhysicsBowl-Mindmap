## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Questions: 2 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Medium (<40)

## Introduction

- Fluid mechanics involves the behavior of liquids and gases at rest (hydrostatics) and in motion (fluid dynamics).
- Applications include buoyancy, pressure changes, and fluid flow (e.g., Bernoulli’s principle).

## Key Concepts

### Density and Buoyancy
- Density:
  $$
  \rho = \frac{m}{V}
  $$
- Archimedes’ Principle:
  - Buoyant force equals the weight of displaced fluid:
  $$
  F_b = \rho_{\text{fluid}} V_{\text{displaced}} g
  $$

### Hydrostatic Pressure
- Pressure in a fluid at rest:
  $$
  P = P_0 + \rho g h
  $$
  - $P_0$: Pressure at the surface.
  - $\rho$: Fluid density.
  - $h$: Depth below the surface.

### Bernoulli’s Equation
- For incompressible, non-viscous flow:
  $$
  P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h = \text{constant}
  $$
  - Links pressure, velocity, and height.

### Continuity Equation
- Conservation of mass in fluid flow:
  $$
  A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
  $$
  - $A$: Cross-sectional area, $v$: velocity.

### Fluid Exit Speed (Torricelli’s Law)
- Fluid speed from a height:
  $$
  v = \sqrt{2 g H}
  $$

### Fluid Motion and Kinematics
- Connection to projectile motion:
  - Use fluid exit speed as initial velocity for projectile equations:
    $$
    x(t) = x_0 + v_{0x} t, \quad y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
    $$

## Question Types

### Buoyancy and Pressure
- Analyze floating or submerged objects.

### Pressure and Fluid Flow
- Calculate pressure changes in pipes or containers.
- Use Bernoulli’s equation for fluid flow problems.

### Fluid Exit Speed
- Calculate the speed of fluid exiting a container.

### Fluid Motion and Kinematics
- Relate fluid exit speed to projectile motion.

## Skills
- Density and Buoyancy:
  - Calculate density and buoyant force.
- Pressure and Fluid Flow:
  - Use pressure and flow equations to solve problems.
- Energy Conservation:
  - Track potential and kinetic energy changes in fluid systems. Note that Bernoulli's equation is a form of the work-energy theorem.
