## Physics Bowl Overview

- Number of Questions: 2 per exam
- Difficulty Level: Medium (<40)

## Introduction

- Fluid mechanics involves the behavior of liquids and gases at rest (hydrostatics) and in motion (fluid dynamics).
- Applications include buoyancy, pressure changes, and fluid flow (e.g., Bernoulli’s principle).

## Key Concepts

### Density and Buoyancy
- **Density**:
  $$
  \rho = \frac{m}{V}
  $$
- **Archimedes’ Principle**:
  - Buoyant force equals the weight of displaced fluid:
  $$
  F_b = \rho_{\text{fluid}} V_{\text{displaced}} g
  $$

### Hydrostatic Pressure
- **Pressure in a fluid at rest**:
  $$
  P = P_0 + \rho g h
  $$
  - $P_0$: Pressure at the surface.
  - $\rho$: Fluid density.
  - $h$: Depth below the surface.

### Bernoulli’s Equation
- **For incompressible, non-viscous flow**:
  $$
  P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h = \text{constant}
  $$
  - Links pressure, velocity, and height.

### Continuity Equation
- **Conservation of mass in fluid flow**:
  $$
  A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
  $$
  - $A$: Cross-sectional area, $v$: velocity.

### Fluid Exit Speed (Torricelli’s Law)
- **Fluid speed from a height**:
  $$
  v = \sqrt{2 g H}
  $$

### Fluid Motion and Kinematics
- **Connection to projectile motion**:
  - Use fluid exit speed as initial velocity for projectile equations:
    $$
    x(t) = x_0 + v_{0x} t, \quad y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
    $$
